# Node Necessities

A NodeJS project with necessities to start a webpage

## To install it you need to:

Install npm modules:

```bash
    $ npm install
```

Start the server (server is currently in debug mode - port 3000):

```bash
    $ npm start
```

Test the server:

```bash
    $ npm test
```

Then set up the files in /config in order to work with your own project

## In this project I've set up ready to use:

* Passport login and sign up thanks to [passport tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local)
* Mongoose setup with User scheme only
* Possibility for easy setup with facebook, 
twitter and google+ according to [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local) 
* Session variables

## Things left to do:

* Setup a socket.io ready to use
* Make prettyer frontend for user profile
